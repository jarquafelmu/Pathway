	<p>Missionaries play a central role in Pathway. Each Pathway site has one or more mission couples who encourage, motivate, and care for the students.</p>
	<p>The missionaries introduce students to the program, guide them through the application and registration process, and mentor them throughout their Pathway experience. The missionaries’ wisdom and experience will help students navigate every aspect of the program, such as using the online courses, leading the gathering discussions, and accessing the many available student resources.</p>
	<p>Above all, the missionaries cheer Pathway students on to success and encourage them to reach their potential by working hard, seeking the Lord’s guidance, and embracing new opportunities.</p>
