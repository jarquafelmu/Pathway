				<h3>What is Pathway?</h3>
				<p>Designed to give students the confidence and skills needed to succeed in college, Pathway is a low-cost educational opportunity that combines online courses with local gatherings. The program takes three semesters, or one year, to complete and can lead to professional certificates and degrees.</p>
				<h3>Can people who are not members of the Church apply?</h3>
				<p>No.  At this time, only members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints can participate in Pathway.</p>
				<h3>How long does it take to complete Pathway?</h3>
				<p>Pathway takes three semesters (one year) to complete. </p>
				<h3>Can I take more than the required 5 credits per semester?</h3>
				<p>Not normally.  You will be taking the same classes as the other students in your gathering. However, if you wish to explore your options for additional classes, contact the Pathway Advising office at <a href="mailto:pathwayadvising@byui.edu">pathwayadvising@byui.edu</a>.</p>
				<h3>Can I miss a gathering?</h3>
				<p>Attendance at weekly Pathway gatherings is required and comprises a significant part of a student’s course grade. Attendance requirements vary by course.</p>
				<h3>Am I required to do Pathway if I already have an associate degree, or can I directly start the online degree I am interested in?</h3>
				<p>In order to be eligible to begin the Online Degree Program, you must have at least 15 credits from a CES school (BYU, BYU-I, BYU-H, LDSBC).  If your associate degree is from one of the Church schools, you can by-pass Pathway.  However, if you don’t meet the requirement of 15 CES credits, you will need to complete Pathway before you will be eligible to apply for the Online Degree Program.</p>
				<h3>I have previous college credit; will it transfer to Pathway?</h3>
				<p>All students are required to complete the specified courses during Pathway regardless of their previous college experience or coursework. Previous course credit cannot be applied to these courses, but may count as transfer credit toward an eventual BYU-Idaho degree. For additional questions or information, contact Pathway Advising at <a href="tel:+12084969898">(208) 496-9898</a>.</p>
				<h3>If I have already taken a Book of Mormon course at an institute of religion, am I still required to take the Book of Mormon course with Pathway?</h3>
				<p>Unless you have taken a Book of Mormon course through one of the CES schools or taken the Book of Mormon at an institute for credit, you will need to take it as part of Pathway.  For more details, contact the Pathway Advising office at <a href="mailto:pathwayadvising@byui.edu">pathwayadvising@byui.edu</a>.</p>
				<h3>Will tuition remain at $65 a credit once I complete Pathway and start the Online Degree Program?</h3>
				<p>Students who complete Pathway and continue on to the BYU-Idaho Online Degree Program will continue to pay the low Pathway tuition rate, whatever it is at the time. Tuition has the potential to increase slightly each year. (The only exception is the online RN to BSN Program. The tuition will not be $65 per credit for this program.) </p>
				<h3>Will tuition remain the same if I enter the RN to BSN program?</h3>
				<p>No. Tuition will cost the same as it does for others in that program.  Please go to the RN to BSN website for tuition cost information.</p>
				<h3>Do I have to start over if I cannot attend a semester of Pathway?</h3>
				<p>If you miss a semester of Pathway, you must reapply to the program.  However, after reapplying, you will not have to retake the semester(s) that you have previously completed. Once you are accepted back into Pathway, you will have to wait for the semester that your Pathway site is offering the courses that you have not taken yet or transfer to another Pathway location.</p>
				<h3>Are there tutors who can help me if I have trouble with my homework?</h3>
				<p>Yes, tutoring is free at BYU-Idaho. You can find an online tutor through the on campus tutoring center at <a href="http://www.byui.edu/academic-support-centers/tutoring-center/online-tutoring">http://www.byui.edu/academic-support-centers/tutoring-center/online-tutoring</a>.</p>
				<h3>Can I get an identification card from BYU-Idaho?</h3>
				<p>No. Campus and Online Degree students enrolled in classes at BYU-Idaho can receive an identification card, also known as an I-Card. Unfortunately; Pathway students are not eligible for I-Cards.  Online students can receive their I-Cards by filling out an application, which can be found at <a href="http://www.byui.edu/financial-services/my-account/i-card/online-student-i-card-application-form">http://www.byui.edu/financial-services/my-account/i-card/online-student-i-card-application-form</a>.</p>
				<h3>How can I obtain enrollment verification?</h3>
				<p>You can obtain enrollment verification through the National Student Clearing House at: <a href="www.byui.edu/verification">www.byui.edu/verification</a>. </p>
				<h3>Is financial aid available to Pathway students?</h3>
				<p>Pathway students are not eligible for Federal Financial Aid or BYU-Idaho scholarships.  However, once a student becomes a degree seeking student, they are then eligible for Federal Financial Aid as long as they meet the requirements, which can be found at the Financial Aid website, <a href="http://www.byui.edu/financial-aid">http://www.byui.edu/financial-aid</a>.</p>
				<h3>Who are the missionaries at my Pathway site?</h3>
				<p>You can find Pathway sites and missionary contact information at: (New Link)</p>
				<h3>How long is a semester?</h3>
				<p>Each semester is 14 weeks long.   Fall semesters start in September and go until the middle of December, winter semesters start in January and go until the middle of April, and spring semesters start at the end of April and go until the end of July.</p>
				<h3>What happens if I fail a class?</h3>
				<p>If you fail a course, you will need to retake it. As a Pathway student, you cannot begin the Online Degree Program unless you have passed every course and have at least a 3.0 cumulative GPA. However, Pathway students can apply to campus with less than a 3.0 GPA if all application requirements (ACT, transcripts, essays, etc.) are met. If they meet the 3.0 GPA, these requirements are waived.  If you have completed Pathway with no failing grades, but do not meet the 3.0 cumulative GPA requirement, you will need to retake your courses with the lowest grades to qualify for the Online Degree Program. </p>
				<h3>Can high school students enroll in Pathway?</h3>
				<p>No.  You must be at least institute age (18 years old.)</p>
				<h3>Can students audit online courses? </h3>
				<p>No.  If a student is found to be auditing an online course, Student Records & Registration will remove the student from the course.</p>
